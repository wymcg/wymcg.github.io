I'm Will McGloughlin, a Software Engineer based out of Chicago. 
I have a passion for embedded and low-level software development, and I excel at prototyping new ideas and systems.
Outside of work, I enjoy listening to music and working on personal projects that help me expand my knowledge.

I'm an avid proponent of Rust, but I also have extensive experience with Python and C/C++. 
In the past, I've also used Go, Java, Javascript and Typescript.

This website is an opportunity for me to share my thoughts on various topics related to software engineering, embedded systems, and low-level programming.
